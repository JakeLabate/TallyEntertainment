# Tally Entertainment

The index.html file is the source code for https://www.tallyentertainment.com. It it the static code that their CMS (Wix) produced in order to make the website function.<br>
<br>
The live/updated source code of this site (any any site) can be found by placing 'view-source:' in front of any website URL (usually cannot be done on a mobile phone). So, this code was retreived at 'view-source:https://www.tallyentertainment.com'.<br>

Found to the left side of this index.html file are comments, when clicked, will reveal annotations I have have about what can be improved in the code. In this case, because I assume Wix is a fairly non-customizable (non code-editing friendly) CMS, someone these changes will be impossible. Im sure however, that some of them could be achived within the Wix platform. I give another tip-of-the-hat to Webflow here... it offers complete code-editing capabilities.<br>
